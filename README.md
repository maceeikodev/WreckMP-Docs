# Welcome to WreckMP docs!

[WreckMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/5271) is a revolutionary FREE multiplayer mod for [My Summer Car](https://store.steampowered.com/app/516750/My_Summer_Car/), developed by [Maceeiko development](https://maceeiko.dev/). 
WreckMP supports [MSCLoader](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/147) ([Github repo](https://github.com/piotrulos/MSCModLoader)), but just supporting mods doesn't mean that all mods will be synced in WreckMP automatically, so that's why you might want to sync your mod!

In this repository you can find documentation and basic tutorials about syncing your mod for WreckMP [in the wiki tab](https://github.com/maceeikodev/WreckMP-Docs/wiki), as well as an open-source example mod formerly created by [Honeycomb936](https://github.com/Moritz448).
